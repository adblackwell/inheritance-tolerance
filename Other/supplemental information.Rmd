## Additional Model Details

### Baseline Mortality
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```


### Probability of switching strategies

### Decay of immunological memory


## Model Code
Complete R code for the model and figures can be found at: github...
The code consists of the functions ...
Models can be run by using...

## Infection profiles for examples in the main paper

### A short-lived infection

### A long-lived infection


##Placental immunization



## Additional examples

### Difficult to clear, low mortality, helminth model

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
